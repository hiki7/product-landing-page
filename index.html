                            Hanamichi Sakuragi, a rowdy high schooler with a fiery red mane and incredible strength, yearns to break his 50-rejection streak and find a girlfriend at Shohoku High. Despite his troubled past, Haruko Akagi, unaware of his history, approaches him about basketball. In a clumsy attempt to impress her, he tries a slam dunk but crashes into the backboard. His unexpected athletic talent catches Haruko's attention, thrusting him into the world of basketball and into a rivalry for a girl he barely knows. Hanamichi soon realizes there's more to basketball than he thought.

As he matures among the battle-loving Danes, he's torn between revenge and survival. When Askeladd plans to influence the future King of England by rescuing Danish prince Canute, their lives are forever changed. "Vinland Saga" unfolds a brutal tale of 11th-century Europe, a world of violence and injustice, where battle is a pleasure for some and hell for others.

                            22-year-old Eikichi Onizuka: pervert, former gang member... and teacher?
                            Great Teacher Onizuka follows the incredible, though often ridiculous, antics of the titular teacher as he attempts to outwit and win over the cunning 
                            Class 3-4 that is determined to have him removed from the school. However, other obstacles present themselves throughoutâ€”including the frustrated, balding vice principal, Hiroshi Uchiyamada; old enemies from his biker days; and his own idiotic teaching methods. But Eikichi fights it all whilst trying to help his students, romance fellow teacher Azusa Fuyutsuki, and earn his self-proclaimed title.
